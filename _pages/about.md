# Ivy (Hong) Zhan  
**PhD Applicant in Applied AI for Engineering & Industrial Systems**  
London, United Kingdom  

My research focuses on building **reliable and data-efficient AI systems for engineering and industrial applications**, especially under conditions of uncertainty, distribution shift, and limited supervision. I am broadly interested in:

- **Robust and trustworthy machine learning** for mission-critical systems  
- **Transformer-based time-series modeling** for multi-sensor industrial data  
- **Uncertainty quantification & Bayesian deep learning**  
- **Data-centric AI for low-label or imbalanced settings** (Active Learning, Causal Data Interventions)  
- **Real-world deployment of AI in predictive maintenance and automated quality inspection**

My long-term goal is to develop **next-generation industrial AI systems** that can reason under uncertainty, learn efficiently from limited data, and remain stable when deployed in real factory and engineering environments.
