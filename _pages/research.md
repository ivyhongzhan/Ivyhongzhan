# Research  

My research sits at the intersection of **Applied AI for Engineering**, **Information Systems & Data Analytics**, and **Educational Technology / Learning Analytics**.  
Across these domains, I focus on developing **reliable, interpretable, and data-efficient machine learning systems** that are deployable in real-world environments.

## 1️⃣ Applied AI for Engineering & Industrial Systems  

I study how to build robust and trustworthy ML models for mission-critical engineering applications such as predictive maintenance and automated quality inspection.

**Topics:**
- Transformer-based time-series modeling for multi-sensor data  
- Robustness and distribution shift in degradation modeling  
- Uncertainty quantification & Bayesian deep learning  
- Data-efficient defect detection in industrial vision  

**Representative work:**
- Temporal Fusion Transformer for turbofan engine prognostics (NASA C-MAPSS)  
- Bayesian Active Learning for industrial visual inspection (MVTec AD)

## 2️⃣ Information Systems & Data Analytics  

Here I focus on using data to understand **organizational and socio-technical systems**: how algorithms shape behavior, how rebalancing strategies affect decisions, and how we can design more reliable data pipelines.

**Topics:**
- Causal analysis of data preprocessing and rebalancing strategies  
- Out-of-distribution performance in real-world analytics pipelines  
- Algorithmic exposure and content amplification on social media  
- Data-centric evaluation of model reliability  

**Representative work:**
- Causal study of oversampling strategies under distribution shift  
- MSc dissertation on algorithmic exposure & cross-context reposting behaviour

## 3️⃣ Educational Technology & Learning Analytics  

I am also interested in applying AI and analytics to **learning processes and education platforms**, leveraging behavioral and interaction data to support learners and instructors.

**Topics:**
- Learning analytics and behavioural modelling  
- Data-driven feedback and intervention design  
- Fairness and transparency of algorithmic recommendations in learning settings  
- Applying uncertainty-aware models to student performance prediction  

**Current/Planned work:**
- Extending my experience in algorithmic exposure and user behaviour modelling  
  to learning platforms and technology-enhanced learning environments.

## 🎯 Long-Term Vision  

My long-term goal is to develop **reliable, interpretable, and data-efficient AI systems** that:  

- operate safely in engineering and industrial settings,  
- support better decision-making in organizations and information systems, and  
- enhance learning outcomes through responsible use of analytics and educational technology.
